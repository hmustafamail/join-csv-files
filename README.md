# join-csv-files
A simple Python script for joining two CSV files on a particular column.

Ever want to join two CSV files without getting some huge software package that you have to click and click and click? Look no further! 

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- Pandas package (`pip3 install pandas`)

## Usage
If you are using the Terminal or CMD, you may use:

`python3 join.py in1.csv in2.csv columntojoinon`

Remember that all of those files must be in the same folder.

Alternatively, you run `join-interactive.py` in the Python IDLE.

## Credits
Thanks to the Pandas developers for maintaining such an excellent library. Thanks to DSM from stackoverflow.com/questions/16265831 for showing how to use it.
